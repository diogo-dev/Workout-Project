This is a project of a workout planner. Nowadays the backend is being implemented, but for now, in order for the data to have persistence, I've used the Indexed.db (To use this database, you need to install it first: npm install idb)

The application have the following pages:
- Home (Motivatinal Quote obtained from NinjaAPI)
- Planner (The user are able to vizualize the workout of a specific day)
- Create Workout Page (The user can create/delete the exercises to his workout and even get workout suggestions that comes from the same NinjaAPI)
- Session (Now it is time to train. The user is able to use the timer to check the workout duration and to monitor the rest time. Also, this page allows to drag exercises from the "To do" column to the "Done" column which is an important action to trak the progression of exercises being concluded)
